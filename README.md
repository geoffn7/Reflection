# Reflection
Script that asks the user questions for reflection and logs the users answers.

## Motivation:
Questions taken from Reinvention by Brian Tracy.
Build a convenient way to reflect and record for future reference.

## Usage:
```
python reflection.py
```

Script will output a log file with format: reflection %Y-%m-%d.txt 

## Next Steps:

1. Clean up and organize questions for the user in order to make reflection less daunting.
2. GUI to make it look pretty and nice to use
